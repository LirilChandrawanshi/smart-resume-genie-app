              <p className="mb-4">
                ResumeGenie was created with a simple mission: to help people create professional, 
                eye-catching resumes without the hassle. Founded in 2025 by Aayushi Solanki, 
                our platform combines intuitive design with powerful AI to make resume creation simple and effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                As someone who has experienced the challenges of job hunting firsthand, 
                Aayushi understood the importance of a well-crafted resume in making a strong first impression. 
                This personal experience inspired the creation of ResumeGenieâ€”a tool that empowers 
                users to highlight their unique skills and experiences.
